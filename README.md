Contains Assets, Code, and Binaries for Stephen Carey's Solar Warfare game: this is the build tree as used in Eclipse.

To run, open the Command Prompt in the root directory and type java -cp bin SolarWarfare4_2

A Login Screen will open. Don't use the username / password / game name fields at the top: those log into pre-existing games that a user had been given an invitation to join. Instead, replaced the Admin Codewords text field with the text (quotations not included) "Mono, Duel" - which will instruct the software to load a game where the same computer plays both sides, on the two-player map called "Duel".

To exit the game, simply tab to the Login Screen and exit that window; that will automatically end thxc  e main program too.
